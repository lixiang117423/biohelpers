\title{Perform principal coordinate analysis (PCoA).}
\usage{
pcoa_analysis(
  data,
  sample,
  method = "bray",
  x = "PCo1",
  y = "PCo2",
  size = 2,
  color = "group",
  alpha = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Feature table, with rows representing samples and columns representing feature values, such as OTUs.}

\item{sample}{Sample table, with the first column containing sample names. There are no specific requirements for the names of the subsequent columns, but the sample names must match those in the feature table.}

\item{method}{The method for calculating distances in vegan::vegdist() is defaulted to Bray-Curtis.}

\item{x}{The principal coordinate used for the X-axis in the plot is defaulted to PCo1.}

\item{y}{The principal coordinate used for the y-axis in the plot is defaulted to PCo2.}

\item{size}{The size of point.}

\item{color}{Column names in the sample data frame used for coloring the points.}

\item{alpha}{The alpha of point.}
}
\value{
A list containing four components:
\describe{
  \item{result.pcoa}{The output from ape::pcoa(), which can be called directly.}
  \item{plot.pcoa}{The plotting results, defaulting to PCo1 and PCo2. The output is a ggplot object, which can be fine-tuned using ggplot2.}
  \item{point.data}{The data used for plotting, which users can call for their own plots or export for use in other software.}
  \item{eigenvalue.pcoa}{The explained variance of the principal coordinates, starting from PCo1 by default.}
}
}
\description{
Perform principal coordinate analysis (PCoA).
